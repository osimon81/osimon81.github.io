<h1> Hello! This is Simon Ogundare's bio. </h1>

<p> I'm a rising junior at Columbia College, majoring in Neuroscience and Behaviour. Outside of school, I play classical piano and jazz saxophone. I'm interested in data science and literacy for public interest because I'm interested in using data to tell meaningful stories about groups of people and sharing unique experiences in particular demographics to inform decisions based on public health. In the future, I'm looking to pursue an MD-PhD program in Neurobiology when I graduate! </p>
